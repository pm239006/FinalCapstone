    <h3 class="card-title text-light text-center">French Bulldog History</h3>
    <p class="card-text text-light"> As by the name “French,” we may assume its root from France. Right? But it’s a wrong assumption. French Bulldogs were first originated in England in the late 18th century. But at the beginning, Bulldogs were tall and heavy as compared to the Bulldogs we see now. So, they were crossbred with Smaller breeds to get a smaller version of a Bulldog, known as “French Bulldog.” </p>

             - Boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs
             - Canned plain pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling)
             - Low-sodium chicken broth
        
           - Instructions:
             1. Boil the chicken until fully cooked, then shred it.
             2. Mix the shredded chicken with canned pumpkin in a ratio of 2 parts chicken to 1 part pumpkin.
